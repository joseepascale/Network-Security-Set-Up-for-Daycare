# Network-Security-Set-Up-for-Daycare

## Scenerio:
In this project, I reinforced my knowledge of network security by designing a secure network topology and configuring various security measures for a daycare center. This was to ensure the daycare's network is secure, protecting sensitive data like children's personal information, while maintaining a stable, efficient network infrastructure.

## Objectives
- Design and implement a secure network topology for the daycare center.
- Configure and customize firewalls for enhanced security.
- Set up secure VPN connections for remote access and file transfers.
- Perform penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities in the system.
 Monitor and log network traffic to detect potential security issues.

### Tools Used
- Windows Defender Firewall: Configured to protect individual devices within the daycare center network.
- pfSense: Used for configuring and managing firewalls, VPNs, and custom firewall rules to ensure network security.
- Wireshark: For capturing and analyzing network traffic to ensure data integrity and security.
- Metasploit/Kali Linux: Used for penetration testing to assess the security of the network and firewall setup.
